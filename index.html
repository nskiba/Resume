	<h2>Hello</h2>

<p>
I'm Natalia Skiba. 

What I really love doing is solving problems, all sorts of problems. 
I'm thrilled when I can implementint some kind of change by breaking it down into realistic pieces, mapping out a plan to successfully accomplish the goals and then making it happen. 
I'm also driven by interaction with people and I'm constantly seeking the best communication strategies that I can deploy to communicate effectively with my team. 
</p>

<p>
My key achievements include:
</p>

<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Leading multinational projects up to 14 countries in Europe, North and South America and Russia</li>
		<li>Coordinating internal teams in a matrix organization</li>
		<li>Managed over 100 thousand Euro budget projects and achieved project scheduled goals</li>
		<li>Conducted a successful workshop during a project delivery to a client located near Philadelphia in the USA at the end of 2016</li>
		<li>Creation of training guides and presentations to facilitate the implementation of new standard operating procedures after the merger (internal workshop in Madrid, Spain at the end of 2016)</li>
		<li>Re-organization of project management processes for qualitative research for better time and resource optimization, resulting in reduced costs and more efficient operations</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>
In my free time I try to take the adventage of everything that Warsaw area has to offer. When I'm not managing projects or learning how to code you can find me exploring nature with my dog, meeting with my family and friends or doing some artistic stuff like drawing or taking pictures. I'm passionate about getting to know new places, new cultures and new technologies.
